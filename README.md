[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/cubadotnetw/CubanWhoCodes/_apis/build/status/jjcolumb.CubanWhoCodes?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/cubadotnetw/CubanWhoCodes/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

Open source project inspired in [https://github.com/AngelGarcia13/DominicanWhoCodes](https://github.com/AngelGarcia13/DominicanWhoCodes), made to expose all the developers from Cuba with their skills and contacts.

We will use this project in our Blazor courses, demos, youtube and twitch videos,etc


# Blazor Client App.

ðŸš€ Azure WebApp (Free Tier): [https://cubanwhocodes.azurewebsites.net/](https://cubanwhocodes.azurewebsites.net/)

# I'm Cuban and I code, how can I add myself to the site?
Just fork the project, add your info in the developers.json and create a pull request. We will approve it and Azure DevOps (CI/CD) will take care of the rest.

# RoadMap

We will move it from Azure Web App to our own server with a custom domain: [Cubanwho.codes](https://www.cubanwho.codes)

# Possible future improvements:

We will add a search and a filter by skills shortly.

Any other need you may have.
